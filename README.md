# Glod - A cross platform Speedrun Timer

This is an Electron/React based timer built for speedruns.
Currently it only has a super basic functionality, but there are plenty of ideas already in the backlog.

So far this has only been compiled and tested on a MacOS environment, still need to test for stability and usability on both Linux and Windows.
